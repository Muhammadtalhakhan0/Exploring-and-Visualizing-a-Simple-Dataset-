# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

## Objective
The objective of this task is to explore and visualize the Iris dataset in order
to understand data trends, feature distributions, and relationships between
different variables using Python.

## Dataset Used
- Iris Dataset
- Source: Seaborn library
- Total Records: 150
- Total Features: 5 (including target class)

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Task Description
In this task, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed on the Iris dataset.
The dataset is loaded, inspected, and analyzed using descriptive statistics.
Different visualizations are created to better understand the dataset.

## Steps Performed
- Loaded the Iris dataset using seaborn
- Inspected dataset shape and column names
- Checked dataset information and missing values
- Generated summary statistics using describe()
- Created visualizations:
  - Scatter plot to observe feature relationships
  - Histograms to analyze data distributions
  - Box plots to identify outliers

## Key Results and Findings
- The dataset contains no missing values
- Petal features clearly distinguish flower species
- Setosa species is easily separable from others
- Some outliers are observed in sepal width
- Visualization helps in understanding data patterns

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates the importance of exploratory data analysis before
applying machine learning models. Understanding data distribution and feature
relationships helps in making better modeling decisions.
